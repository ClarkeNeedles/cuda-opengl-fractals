# Project Milestone: Core Architecture Setup

Fantastic progress! The foundational engineering proof-of-concept is complete. The build chain issues are resolved, and the system is successfully processing shared graphics memory.

## 🚀 Accomplishments

* **Fixed Build Chain Integration**: Resolved the custom CUDA template driver and header linking conflicts.
* **Interoperability Functional**: Successfully established active memory buffer sharing between CUDA and OpenGL.
* **RTX 3070 Processing**: The GPU is actively computing iteration math on the device and drawing the Mandelbrot set directly onto the screen viewport canvas.

## 🏗️ New Target System Architecture

To prepare for complex features like dynamic input handling and high-fidelity timing metrics, the single-file layout will be refactored into a scalable, object-oriented module hierarchy managed via CMake.

## 📋 Next Development Phases

### 1. Code Refactoring (Current Objective)
- [ ] Migrate raw global variables into distinct context classes (`App`, `OpenGLContext`).
- [ ] Isolate pure CUDA calculation logic away from window management files.
- [ ] Construct the master `CMakeLists.txt` file to stitch these nested folders back together.

### 2. User Input Integration
- [ ] Implement GLFW key callbacks for camera transformations (WASD / Arrows to pan).
- [ ] Implement mouse wheel hook structures to calculate smooth real-time scale zooming.

### 3. Performance Benchmarking
- [ ] Integrate highly accurate hardware-level system clocks (using `std::chrono` or native CUDA Events).
- [ ] Calculate, track, and display real-time Frame Generation Times (ms) and FPS directly inside the window title bar.
